# ev-energy-charger
A simple mobile app prototype to view and select nearby public charging stations.

# Approach:
1. Initialized a new React Native project using Expo with TypeScript.
2. Used the openchargemap.org API to fetch and display charging stations.
3. Allowed users to select a station and start charging with mock ev.energy backend.

# Running the Project.
1. Clone the repository. - git clone https://github.com/devsoft0615/my-app\
2. Install dependencies: npm install
3. Run the project: expo start


# Future Work - If I have some time
1. **Styling and UX**: While we kept it minmal due to the scope of this challenge, the next step would be to make itmore user-friendly.
2. **Scalability**: To do that, separate to the App.tsx and components.
3. **Error Handling**: Better error handling strategies, especially for API calls.
4. **Caching**: Cache the resultes of nearby stations to reduce redundant API calls.
5. **Integration with Maps**: Display charging stations on a map.
6. **User Preferences**: Allow users to set preferences like type of charger, cost, etc.
7. **Feedback System**: Allow users to provide feedback on charing stations.
8. **Testing Strategies**: Using Jest or Detox, implemented the testing strategies.

# Closing Notes
I focuesd on the core functionality given the limited timeframe, ensuring we met the primary objectives. Future enhancements have been listed to ensure a holistic approach for this app. Looking forward to feedback and further discussions!
